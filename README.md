Solving the challenge from DIO basic python course

DOCUMENTATION ABOUT THE DIO PROJECT CHALLENGE

This Project was a simple challenge to simulate a bank transaction, as expected the solution would be delivered in Python and run console-only.
There is no big secret about what must be done, a variable that would hold the balance and two more one for deposit and one to withdraw, the rest would be two simple functions to add and subtract between them, and finally, a loop to choose between the options from input.

Since the course is aimed at beginners and I see myself as one it would be natural to look at the repo the teacher made available and copy the core code from there.
In my case, I already had a clear idea of the steps to develop the app but I just didn't want to copy it at the same time. And of course, the whole boot camp has a time limit to do.

So I decided to use help from the two top AI “companions” available at this time (June 2024), but I already use them for other tasks I just didn't knew their recent updates were so amazing, and at the same time so humbling...
I also wanted to make it more difficult for myself, so I finally decided to make the simple console one and two more using flask as a back end.
The two AIs used were bard and gpt4o.
GPT4o version is miles away it gave a perfect running app with not even an alert about anything all features added no discussion or trying to "teach".
Bard gave a not configured app that runs but presents browser issues has no css and no dark and light features as was first prompted and it has this teaching approach that is time consuming and repetitive.
So this is it this doc will be used in the repo of the three projects the simple console one and the other using browser input and routing.
If the developers really have much more advanced iterations already waiting there's really no point in so many folks studying basic coding, it is too much of a trivial task for companies to waste time unfortunately, and for those delusional who are avoiding developers to use the tech, they are completely missing market edge and will pay dearly in the next few years.
